                    <p>I didn't encounter any major difficulties, I had some dilemmas on how to present the thing,
                         I was wondering how to display the tiles, whether to use nested divs or ready-made Cards,
                         so in the end I used Cards. I took some time to apply Redux since it was my first time using it,
                         but it didn't take me more than 40 minutes. I gave up testing, I realize that they are very important in commercial solutions,
                         but I decided to focus on other aspects of my work. Everything is written in pure JavaScript,
                         but I know the basics of TypeScript because I used it in one class at my university.</p>

                        I really liked the topic of this task, I liked the fact that I can do the whole thing according to my will
                        while maintaining certain rules imposed by the author. I like to reflect people's expectations for the work I do.
                        I've been working well with the message display API. I had a lot of fun creating a way to display elements and
                        creating a page that is responsive.
